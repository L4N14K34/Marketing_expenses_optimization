**Data :** 3 CSV files provided by the business.

**Findings and recommendations:**
- Marketing expenses are higher then total revenues, hence Yandex.Afisha marketing needs investment returns to be positive.
- We recommend to increase users flow mainly from source 1, but also from sources 2,5 and 9, since they are most  fruitful sources in terms of ROMI.
- On the other hand source 3 brings less ROMI to marketing thus marketing should consider to cut it out and invest it more profitable sources. The top 3 sources marketing spend most are 3,4 and 5. while source 3 is more than double than others. Also CAC per source analysis revealed that source 3 is least succesful for marketing.
- Additional marketing optimization recommendetions would be to focus on September 2017 cohort since its' LTV and average check over time is the highest.
- And also June 2017 cohort has the highest retention rate as well as average highest purchase size, hence highest active buyers than any other cohort. We would recommend to analyze this cohort further and tailor Yandex.Afisha service to it.
